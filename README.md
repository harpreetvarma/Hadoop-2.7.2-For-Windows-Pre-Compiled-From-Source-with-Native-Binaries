Hadoop-2.7.2-on-Windows-with-Native-Binaries


Hadoop provides native support for windows from version 2.2. As of now, Apache Hadoop didn't provide official Release / Support for Windows Users.

So I have Downloaded the official source package from here:
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.7.2/hadoop-2.7.2-src.tar.gz

and built a Windows Package For Windows 64bit Users.


I have even Posted Some Images of this Hadoop Distribution working Perfectly at my blog.
